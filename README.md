# Blockswap

Blockswap is an experimental distributed file storage system based on [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). Files stored with blockswap are turned into blocks then distributed among connected peers.
